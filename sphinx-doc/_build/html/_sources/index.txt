Welcome to Zelig!
=================
**Zelig** is a framework for interfacing with a wide range of statistical models and analytic methods in a common and simple way. Above and beyond estimation, Zelig adds considerable infrastructure to existing heterogenous R implementations by translating coefficients into interpretable quantities of interest and automating statistical procedures (e.g., bootstrapping) though an intelligible call structure.

For more information about the software including goals and direction of the project, please see the :ref:`about` page. To get started, we recommend following the :ref:`quickstart` and checking out the :ref:`userguide`.
