Welcome to Zelig!
=================

**Zelig** is a framework for interfacing with a wide range of statistical models and analytic methods in a common and simple way. Above and beyond estimation, it adds considerable infrastructure to existing heterogeneous R implementations by translating coefficient estimates into interpretable quantities of interest and automating statistical procedures (e.g., bootstrapping) though an intelligible call structure.


To get started, we recommend following the :ref:`installation_quickstart` guide. More information about the software, including our technical vision and goals for the project, can be found at the :ref:`about` page. 


To view the code-base, visit the source repository at `https://github.com/IQSS/Zelig <https://github.com/IQSS/Zelig>`_ and for regular updates  and release information be sure to follow us on twitter at `@IQSS <https://twitter.com/IQSS>`_. We also recommend joining the `Zelig Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zelig-statistical-software>`_, where we are encouraging users to ask questions, report bugs, and help others.

We can also get the `PDF <http://zeligproject.org/build/latex/Zelig.pdf>`_
